We will closely follow LMDB's development towards version 1.0, and accordingly adjust
LMDB_File.

We plan the following read-map for LMDB_File 1.0, in no particular order:

- Implement the perldbmfilter(1) API
- Implement the use of MBD_RESERVE for LMDB_File::put
- Complete documentation
- Tested multi-threading support
- Complete the test harness
