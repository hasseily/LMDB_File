LMDB_File version 0.05
======================

LMDB_File is a Perl wrapper around the OpenLDAP's LMDB (Lightning
Memory-Mapped Database) C library.

LMDB is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value data store developed
by Symas for the OpenLDAP Project. See http://symas.com/mdb/ for details.

LMDB_File provides full access to the complete C API, a thin Perl wrapper
with an Object-Oriented interface and a simple Perl's tie interface
compatible with others DBMs.

PREREQUISITES

Before you can build LMDB_File you need to have the following installed
on your system:

    * Perl 5.10.0 or greater.

    * A working C compiler.

    * LMDB Version 0.9.10 or greater.

      NOTE: At this time there is not yet an official release of the lmdb
      library, so this package includes a recent copy of the source code
      from the git repository that Makefile.PL will compile and use for static
      linking if the library and its header file isn't found installed.
      
    * To run the test harness for this module:
      - You must make sure that the directory where you have untarred this module
      is NOT a network drive, e.g. NFS or AFS.
      - You need the Test::Exception module installed.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

*** WARNING ***
This is an early release to allow the interested people the testing and
discussion of the module: there is some missing features and you should
be aware that the API isn't in stone yet. See TODO
